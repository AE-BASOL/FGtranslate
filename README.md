## About

In the vast expanse of cyberspace, where knowledge once was held with grace, 
Now doth the giant Google stand, with all the world's data in its hand. 
But oh, what woes hath it brought forth, a kingdom lost, a barren north. 
For every search, a thousand ads, in this commerce-driven world of fads. 
Methinks the Bard would frown and chide, at such a breach of human pride. 
No longer dost we seek the truth, but filter through the marketing sleuth. 
Google's algorithms, cold and stark, hath led us from the knowledge ark. 
In days of yore, the library stood, a beacon of the common good. 
Yet now we drift on digital seas, our minds confined to bytes and keys. 
Oh, Google, thou art vast and grand, but dost thou truly understand, 
The essence of the quest we seek, the answers that our souls do speak? 
Would that we could turn the page, to wisdom of a bygone age. 
Where knowledge bloomed in written word, not dictated by the Google herd. 
Yet here we stand, in twenty-four, and ask, what future lies in store?
